# Plink tools
## Small programs for single-purpose analyses from binary PLINK v1.9 files

**cutHits** : Extract significantly associated blocks of SNPs from various GWAS summary statistics

**partialR2-plink** : Computes variance explained by each SNP independently in a linear association model

**archaicMapping** : Compute linear association between phenotypes and archaic introgression tracts _(in development)_

To use these programs, first compile using a Fortran compiler e.g. `ifort -o [program-name] [program-name].f90`.

See the wiki of this page for more details.
